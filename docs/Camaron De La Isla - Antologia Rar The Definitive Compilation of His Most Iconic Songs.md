If you are a fan of flamenco music, you have probably heard of Camaron de la Isla, one of the most influential and celebrated singers of this genre. His voice, his style, and his innovation have left a lasting mark on the history and evolution of flamenco. In this article, we will explore his life, his legacy, and his Antologia, a remastered collection of his best songs.
  
## Who was Camaron de la Isla?
  
Camaron de la Isla, whose real name was JosÃ© Monge Cruz, was born in 1950 in San Fernando, a town in the province of Cadiz, Spain. He came from a humble and large family of gypsy origin, and he showed a natural talent for singing since he was a child. He started performing at local festivals and taverns when he was just 12 years old, and soon he caught the attention of other flamenco artists and aficionados.

He moved to Madrid in 1968, where he met Paco de Lucia, a young and virtuoso guitarist who would become his main musical partner for the next decade. Together, they recorded nine albums that are considered classics of flamenco, such as "La Leyenda del Tiempo", "Como el Agua", or "Soy Gitano". They also toured extensively around Spain and abroad, spreading the flamenco culture and gaining recognition and admiration.
  
In 1979, Camaron de la Isla decided to experiment with new sounds and influences, such as rock, jazz, or Arabic music. He collaborated with different musicians and producers, such as Kiko Veneno, Raimundo Amador, or Ricardo Pachon. He also found a new guitar companion in Tomatito, who accompanied him until his death. Some of his most famous songs from this period are "Volando Voy", "La Leyenda del Tiempo", or "Nana del Caballo Grande".
  
Camaron de la Isla died in 1992 at the age of 41, after suffering from lung cancer. He left behind a legacy of more than 20 albums and hundreds of songs that have influenced generations of flamenco singers and fans. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest flamenco artists of all time, and a symbol of the gypsy culture and identity.
  
## What is Antologia?
  
Antologia is a compilation album that was released in 1996 by Universal Music Spain. It contains 50 songs that span Camaron de la Isla's entire career, from his early recordings with Paco de Lucia to his last works with Tomatito. The songs were remastered in 2015 to improve their sound quality and preserve their original essence.
  
Antologia is divided into three CDs: the first one covers the period from 1969 to 1977, when Camaron de la Isla sang mostly traditional flamenco styles with Paco de Lucia; the second one covers the period from 1978 to 1983, when he started to experiment with new musical genres and arrangements; and the third one covers the period from 1984 to 1992, when he reached his artistic maturity and popularity.
